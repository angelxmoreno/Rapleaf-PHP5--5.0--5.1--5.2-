For general information regarding API, visit https://www.rapleaf.com/developers/api_docs/personalization/direct
The personalization API's terms and conditions are stated at http://www.rapleaf.com/developers/api_usage

This PHP Class was created because the PHP Lib provided by Rapleaf was not compatible with my PHP 5.2 server.

h1. Usage and examples:
First you need to include the PHP file and instantiate RapleafApiPHP5 object by passing you api key:

<pre><code>
include 'RapleafApiPHP5.php';
$api_key = 'YouAPIKeyHere';
$rpClient = new RapleafApiPHP5($api_key);
</code></pre>

You now have access to the methods in the RapleafApiPHP5 class. Below are examples on how to use it:

<pre><code>
//the email is case-crazy to show when doing a strtolower is needed
$email = 'AnGeLxMoReNo@GmAiL.CoM';
$first_name = 'Angel';
$last_name = 'Moreno';
$street = '123 west no way street';
$city = 'Beverly Hills';
$state = 'CA';
$zip4 = '90210-1234';

//query_by_email
$response = $rpClient->query_by_email($email);

//query_by_email hashed
$response = $rpClient->query_by_email($email, true);

//query_by_md5
$response = $rpClient->query_by_md5(md5(strtolower($email)));

//query_by_sha1
$response = $rpClient->query_by_sha1(sha1(strtolower($email)));

//query_by_name_and_postal no email
$response = $rpClient->query_by_name_and_postal($first_name, $last_name, $street, $city, $state);

//query_by_name_and_postal with email
$response = $rpClient->query_by_name_and_postal($first_name, $last_name, $street, $city, $state, $email);

//query_by_name_and_zip no email
$response = $rpClient->query_by_name_and_zip($first_name, $last_name, $zip4);

//query_by_name_and_zip with email
$response = $rpClient->query_by_name_and_zip($first_name, $last_name, $zip4, $email);
</code></pre>
